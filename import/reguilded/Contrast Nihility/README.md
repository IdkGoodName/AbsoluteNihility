# Contrast Nihility

Really dark colour scheme of ["Within the Cosmos"](https://github.com/IdkGoodName/WithinTheCosmos) theme for Guilded. This is an alternative version of Absolute Nihility with a little more contrast.

## Setting Colours

The background, foreground and other colours are not available to be set. But accent colours and selection can be changed.

Absolute Nihility has orange to yellow accent by default, but you can set them using `--accent-0`, `--accent-1`, `--accent-2`. The bigger the number is, the more dull it is supposed to be. Links will use `--accent-1` and hovered links will use `--accent-2`.

There is also `--accent-selection` for selection and `--accent-foreground` to set the theme foreground (black by default. If you are going for a dark colour accent, set this as white).
